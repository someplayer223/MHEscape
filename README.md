# MHEscape
Development of MHEscape
Hello, my name is Maxwell Eppirson and I am the lead developer of MHEscape. MHEscape is a game in which you escape a sort of haunted school 
environment using clues found around the world. With these clues, you try to find different tools to unlock a different stage in the game. This github is just for visitors
to track our progress with the game and is not intended for playing just yet. We hope to set up a download link for people wanting to play
the game at later date.
